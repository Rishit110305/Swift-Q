**Rishit Goswami** *Full-Stack Developer*

“I’m a developer who’s deeply passionate about backend engineering. While frontend shows the beauty of an application, what excites me more is the logic that powers it — how data is processed, how systems communicate, and how everything works reliably behind the scenes. I enjoy understanding and implementing the core mechanics that make applications function at scale.”
